    "## The Representation of Women in Film -- A Data Science Tutorial by Michelle Badalov \n",
    "\n",
    "Women's presence in the performing arts dates back to the early 1660s, however the history of theater goes as far back as 532 BC when the Greeks began putting on tragedies. 'What is the reason for this temporal gap?' one might ask. Well, women were not allowed on the stage for many centuries because it was considered \"dangerous\". In fact, men were responsible for portraying both male and female characters all that time (NC Theatre, 2015). Fast forward to 2022, and we see that women are still not offered equal opportunity in the performing arts. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is no question that the representation of women in film is deeply flawed and biased. Despite the fact that half of the world is comprised of women, an overwhelming amount of films lack female roles and even fewer accurately portray the female experience. \n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting measure of this representation uses the Bechdel Test (BT). This test was coined by Alison Bechdel's comic in a 1985 strip called 'The Rule'. For more information on its origin, one can find an insightful introduction to the comic on feministfrequency.com.\n",

    "According to the comic, to pass the Bechdel Test, a film must satisfy three criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The film has at least two women in it, \n",
    "2. the women in the film must speak to each other at least once, \n",
    "3. the conversation between the women must be about something besides men.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seems easy enough, right? We will explore just how simple an expectation this is throughout the tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, I will be investigating three questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How many films pass the Bechdel test per year? \n",
    "2. How has this ratio changed over time?\n",
    "3. How do films passing the Bechdel Test perform in comparison to those who don't?\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, I hope to gain perspective  on the reality of female representation in film, as well as the public perception of female representation in film. "

    "#### Data collection/curation + parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "http://Bechdeltest.com provides an up-to-date and easy to access list of movies that do or don't pass the test. On the website, there is a link to add new movies and one can suggest a re-rating of a movie by leaving a comment on the movie page. Using the API (documentation can be found at https://bechdeltest.com/api/v1/doc) one can query the list. All calls will look like http://bechdeltest.com/api/v1/method?params where the methods and necessary parameters are given in the documentation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The website provides four methods to query the list: getMovieByimdbId, getMoviesByTitle, getAllMovieIds, getAllMovies. I will be using getAllMovies as I will be working with the all of the features. The query returns a JSON object containing the following information about each movie: year, rating, title, ID, and imdb ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, I can use Python's requests and json modules to extract the object. Using pandas, I can then store the JSON contents in a dataframe. \n",

    "Now, I am interested in my second question, 'How has this ratio changed over time?', for which I will be making a scatter plot. Scatter plots are ideal for tracking smaller-scale changes over time (NCES, 2022). I can deduce from my raw data and the above bar graph that the ratios do not change dramatically over time, so a scatter plot is perfect for this scenario. Further, adding a line of best fit will best help address how the ratio has or has not improved over the 21st century. \n",

    "Being a young woman myself, I am not surprised that the number of films which pass the Bechdel test is less than outstanding. However, I learned a number of things from this study. \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, I had no idea the Bechdel Test existed. Honestly, I never paid much attention to the way women communicated in films. This gain of knowledge brought me many realizations. Films are made to portray real life, to some extent. Clearly, they have been failing at this. \n",
    "\n",
    "I find power, safety, respect, and acceptance amongst other women. The allegiance  between women is what has allowed us to break through so many barriers. Winning the rights to vote, to serve alongside men in the military, and to equal pay were not little feats, and would not have been made possible without each other's support. It's heart breaking to see that our allegiance  and mutual respect has been under-represented and undermined. I hope this tutorial sheds light to others as it did to me on the representation of women in film. Further, I hope this inspires others to join the fight for accurate portrayal of women in film, especially considering my second insight: \n",
    "#### The gap is not predicted to close until 2079. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is over 50 years from now. That is over 50 years of women not even speaking to each other in movies. This is unacceptable. I encourage all viewers of this tutorial to sign the following petition https://www.thepetitionsite.com/215/165/177/pass-the-bechdel-test/ so that the film industry might one day ensure all films pass the Bechdel Test. \n"
